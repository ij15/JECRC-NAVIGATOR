# JECRC-NAVIGATOR
#The Aim of this project was to create an app that 
  helps in navigating the campus with easiness. It 
  will help you find directions from one block to 
  another. It also gives you the time and distance
  needed to reach your destination. You can also 
  find the floors and blocks of Classrooms and labs
